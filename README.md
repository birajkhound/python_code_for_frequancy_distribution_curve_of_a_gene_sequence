Chargaff’s second parity rule is an intriguing concept related to the composition of DNA. Let’s dive into the details:

1. Chargaff’s Rules Recap:
  - Erwin Chargaff, an Austrian-born chemist, made significant contributions to our understanding of DNA composition.
  - His first rule states that in any double-stranded DNA molecule, the percentage of adenine (A) equals the percentage of thymine (T), and the percentage of guanine (G) equals the percentage of cytosine ©.
  - This rule laid the foundation for the Watson-Crick base pairs in the DNA double helix model.

2. Chargaff’s Second Parity Rule:
  - Discovered in 1968, the second parity rule extends our understanding of DNA composition.
  - It focuses on single-stranded DNA and reveals an interesting symmetry:
  -- The number of adenine (A) units is approximately equal to the number of thymine (T) units: %A ≈ %T.
  -- Similarly, the number of cytosine © units is approximately equal to the number of guanine (G) units: %C ≈ %G.
  - Essentially, this rule highlights the balanced occurrence of complementary bases within a single DNA strand.

3. Implications and Significance:
  - Chargaff’s second parity rule has several implications:
  -- Base Pairing Symmetry: It reinforces the idea that DNA strands are complementary, with A pairing with T and C pairing with G.
  -- Genomic Consistency: Regardless of the species or complexity, the overall base composition adheres to this rule.
  -- Genome Size and Exceptions: While it holds for most genomes (including eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral), exceptions exist, especially in organellar genomes (e.g., mitochondria and plastids) and single-stranded DNA genomes.

The biological basis for this rule is still under investigation, but it provides valuable insights into genome organization and evolution.

To generate a frequency distribution curve using this Python program you just need to 
- Run this code on any Python IDE
- insert the name of the sequence file as input(the program and the sequence file should be in the same directory)
- this program deals with files that contain only one gene sequence.
